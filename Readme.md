# NFT Evolution Contract

## Project Title
**NFT Evolution Contract** - Dynamic NFTs that Grow with Time and Interaction

## Project Description
The NFT Evolution Contract is an innovative smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that creates dynamic, evolving Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Unlike traditional static NFTs, these tokens change and evolve based on two key factors: the passage of time since creation and user interactions with the NFT. This creates a living, breathing digital asset that grows alongside its owner's engagement.

Each NFT starts at evolution level 0 and progressively evolves as days pass and as the owner interacts with it. The evolution mechanism rewards both patience and active engagement, creating a unique gamified experience for NFT holders.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the NFT space by creating dynamic digital assets that provide ongoing value and engagement to their owners. We aim to move beyond static JPEGs to create NFTs that tell a story, grow with their community, and provide continuous utility through their evolutionary mechanics.

We envision a future where NFTs are not just collectibles, but living digital companions that respond to their owner's dedication and the passage of time, creating deeper emotional connections between collectors and their digital assets.

## Key Features

**🕒 Time-Based Evolution**
- NFTs automatically evolve based on the number of days since their creation
- Long-term holding is rewarded with higher evolution levels

**🤝 Interaction-Driven Growth**
- Users can actively interact with their NFTs to accelerate evolution
- Every 5 interactions contribute to the next evolution level

**📈 Progressive Leveling System**
- NFTs start at level 0 and can theoretically evolve indefinitely
- Evolution level increases based on combined time and interaction factors
